# How to Deal With Gaslighting in a Relationship

The term "Gaslighting" was the Merriam-Webster Word of the Year in 2022, and it remains one of the most highly searched relationship psychology terms in India in 2024. 

While the word is often casually misused to describe someone casually lying or being stubborn, actual gaslighting is a highly systematic, intensely destructive form of completely intentional **emotional abuse**. 

A gaslighter's primary goal is to gain power over you by making you question your own memory, perception, and sanity. Here is how to identify if you are being gaslighted in your marriage, and the exact psychological steps you must take to protect yourself.

## Common Examples of Gaslighting in Indian Marriages

Gaslighting often thrives in traditional Indian households because of hierarchical power structures (like age, gender, or financial earning power) which abusers hide behind. 

**Watch for these 4 distinct gaslighting tactics:**

### 1. The Direct Counter
They blatantly deny a conversation or event ever happened, even when you have proof.
*Example:* You remind your husband he promised to visit your parents this weekend. He replies, *"I never said that. You are completely imagining things. Why do you always make up lies in your head?"*

### 2. Trivializing (The "Overreacting" Defense)
They invalidate your emotional response to their objectively terrible behavior.
*Example:* Your wife flirts aggressively with a family friend in front of you. When you bring it up in the car, she laughs and says, *"You are so insecure and paranoid. It was a joke. Why are you always overreacting?"*

### 3. Shifting the Blame
They behave terribly, but somehow spin the narrative so that their bad behavior is entirely your fault.
*Example:* They scream at you for an hour. When you start crying, they say, *"Well, if you weren't constantly nagging me when I got home from work, I wouldn't have to yell at you. Look what you made me do."*

### 4. Withholding
They refuse to listen or pretend they can't understand you, just to frustrate you into giving up.
*Example:* *"I'm not having this conversation. You’re just trying to confuse me again with your ridiculous logic."*

## The Psychological Damage of Gaslighting

Over the course of five or ten years, being systematically gaslighted causes massive, complex trauma. 

You begin suffering from "Decision Fatigue." Because you no longer trust your own capacity to perceive reality correctly, you become incapable of making simple decisions (like what to order for dinner or what to wear) without seeking your abuser's approval. You constantly apologize for things you did not do. You become a shell of your former vibrant self.

## 4 Steps to Deal With a Gaslighter

You cannot "argue" your way out of gaslighting, because facts do not matter to a gaslighter—only power matters. You must use defensive strategies.

### Step 1: Stop Arguing the Facts
When they say, *"I never said that,"* do not spend 45 minutes passionately trying to prove they did to force them to admit it. They will never admit it. 
**Drop the rope.** Say, *"We remember the conversation differently. I know my truth,"* and physically walk away. You take away all their power when you refuse to debate your own reality.

### Step 2: Keep Secret Receipts
Because gaslighting erodes your memory over time, you must keep an external record. Keep a digital journal (password protected) on your phone. Write down the dates, times, and exact quotes of major arguments. When you feel "crazy" a week later, re-read your notes to ground yourself back in reality.

### Step 3: Build an "External Anchor"
Gaslighters systematically isolate you from your friends and family so that they become your only source of truth. Break the isolation. Confide in one highly trusted friend. Tell them exactly what is happening. Use them to reality-check scenarios. *"Hey, am I crazy for being upset that he did X?"* 

### Step 4: Seek Professional Coaching
If you are deeply entangled with a chronic gaslighter, couples counseling is incredibly dangerous. The gaslighter will often charm the therapist and spin the narrative to make *you* look like the unstable, hysterical partner. 

You need **Individual Relationship Coaching**. A coach acts as an objective third party whose only job is to validate your reality, rebuild your shattered self-esteem, and help you formulate a safe exit plan if the emotional abuse does not stop.
