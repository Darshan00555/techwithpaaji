# How to Rekindle Romance After Years of Marriage

"We love each other, but we feel like glorified roommates." 

This is the most common phrase relationship coaches hear from couples who have been married for over five years. The intense, heart-pounding passion of the honeymoon phase has faded. It’s been replaced by EMI payments, grocery lists, changing diapers, demanding corporate jobs, and sheer exhaustion.

Many couples panic when this happens, assuming it means they have "fallen out of love." The truth is much more mundane: Passion isn’t dead; it’s just sleeping under a mountain of domestic chores. 

Here is how you can intentionally revive the spark and intimacy in your long-term marriage.

## The Myth of Spontaneous Desire

In the beginning of a relationship, desire is *spontaneous*. You look at each other across a room and instantly feel electricity. 

However, in long-term marriages, spontaneous desire naturally decreases. What replaces it is *responsive desire*. This means you might not feel "in the mood" while doing the dishes, but if your partner initiates affection in the right context, your desire wakes up and responds.

Stop waiting for lightning to strike spontaneously. In a long-term marriage, romance must be engineered.

## 4 Strategies to Rekindle the Spark

### 1. Re-Establish the "20-Second Hug"
Physical touch releases oxytocin (the bonding hormone) and lowers cortisol (the stress hormone). When couples drift apart, non-sexual touch is usually the first thing to disappear.

**The Fix:** Every single day, when you or your spouse returns home, stop what you are doing. Stand up, greet them, and hug them tightly for at least 20 seconds. It forces your nervous systems to co-regulate. It silently communicates: *"You are my safe harbor after a hard day."*

### 2. Implement the 2/2/2 Rule
Couples who wait until "we have free time" to go on a date will never go on a date—there is never free time. You must schedule intimacy with the same rigid discipline as a corporate meeting.
The 2/2/2 rule is a great framework:
- Every **2 weeks**: Go out for an evening date. (No talking about kids, chores, or in-laws).
- Every **2 months**: Go away for a weekend. (Book a staycation or an Airbnb nearby).
- Every **2 years**: Take a one-week vacation alone. (Leave the children with the grandparents).

### 3. Change Your Environment 
If you eat at the same table, watch the same Netflix shows on the same couch, and go to sleep at the exact same time every day, your brain shuts off its novelty receptors. Passion thrives on novelty.

**The Fix:** You don’t need an expensive vacation to inject novelty. Go for a drive at midnight. Try a completely new cuisine downtown that neither of you has ever eaten. Take a pottery class together. When you experience new things together, your brain releases dopamine, which mimics the feeling of falling in love.

### 4. Practice "Active Appreciation"
Over the years, we hyper-focus on our partner’s flaws (the wet towel on the bed, the loud chewing) and completely ignore their virtues because we expect them. 

**The Fix:** Once a day, compliment them on something *specific*. "Thank you for making tea this morning, it was exactly what I needed." "You handled that situation with my mother so gracefully." Being seen and appreciated is incredibly seductive.

## The Role of a Relationship Coach

If you have tried dates and compliments, but there is deep-seated resentment blocking your physical intimacy, it’s not just a "spark" issue—it’s a connection issue. Resentment is the absolute ultimate enemy of desire.

A relationship coach can help you excavate those buried resentments, clear the toxic air, and rebuild the emotional safety required for physical intimacy to flourish again.

You don’t have to settle for a "roommate marriage." The fire is still there; you just need to learn how to fan the flames.
