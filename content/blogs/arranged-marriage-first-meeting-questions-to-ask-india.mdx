# Arranged Marriage First Meeting: 15 Crucial Questions You Must Ask

"So, what are your hobbies?" 
"Do you like watching movies?"
"Can you cook?"

If you are entering the arranged marriage market in India in 2024, these surface-level questions will not save you from a disastrous match. 

The modern arranged marriage setup has evolved. Families may match your Kundalis and verify your professional background, but *you* are responsible for ensuring emotional, financial, and psychological compatibility. The "first meeting" (whether supervised in a drawing room or at an upscale coffee shop) is your most critical interview. 

As relationship coaches, we see marriages collapse daily because couples ignored the "hard questions" during their courtship. Here are the 15 absolutely crucial questions you must ask to uncover a prospect's true personality.

## Category 1: Career, Finances & Gender Roles

Financial incompatibility is a leading cause of divorce in India. Do not be shy about discussing money.

**1. "How do you envision managing finances after marriage?"**
*Why ask this?* You need to know if they expect a joint account, split bills (50/50), or if they prefer to manage everything while giving you an allowance.
**2. "What is your stance on my career continuing or scaling up after we have kids?"**
*Why ask this?* Many progressive men claim to support a working wife, but expect her to drop everything the moment a child is born. Get specific.
**3. "How do you view the division of household chores?"**
*Why ask this?* This exposes deeply ingrained patriarchal mindsets. If they say "I'll help you occasionally," it implies the mental load is 100% yours. Look for partners who view housework as a shared survival skill, not a gendered duty.
**4. "Do you have any existing financial responsibilities toward your extended family?"**
*Why ask this?* You need to know if 40% of their salary goes to paying off a sibling's loan or supporting parents. This drastically impacts your future lifestyle.

## Category 2: In-Laws and Boundaries

In India, you marry the family. This is non-negotiable.

**5. "Are we living with your parents after marriage, or independently?"**
*Why ask this?* Never assume. Get absolute clarity on the living arrangement on date one.
**6. "How involved are your parents in your major life decisions? (e.g., career moves, investments)"**
*Why ask this?* It tests for enmeshment. You are looking for a partner who respects their parents, but acts as an independent adult. If their parents dictate their bank accounts, their parents will dictate your marriage.
**7. "If there is a disagreement between me and your parents, how would you handle it?"**
*Why ask this?* The gold-standard answer is: "I will listen to both sides, but as a couple, we must present a united front." If they say, "My parents are strictly to be obeyed," walk away.

## Category 3: Lifestyle, Religion, and Core Values

**8. "How religious or spiritual are you in your daily life?"**
*Why ask this?* If you are an atheist and they require daily pujas and fasting, the daily friction will destroy the romance.
**9. "What is your relationship with alcohol, smoking, and dietary habits?"**
*Why ask this?* Strict vegetarians marrying heavy drinkers/non-vegetarians often face immense lifestyle friction in the same kitchen.
**10. "How do you typically spend your weekends?"**
*Why ask this?* If their ideal weekend is sleeping for 14 hours and playing video games, and yours is hiking and socializing, you will end up leading parallel, lonely lives.

## Category 4: Emotional Intelligence and Conflict

**11. "When you get extremely angry, how do you express it?"**
*Why ask this?* Look for red flags like throwing things, silent treatments lasting for days, or screaming. You want someone who needs space to cool down, but returns to resolve the issue calmly.
**12. "What is the biggest lesson you learned from your past relationships or heartbreaks?"**
*Why ask this?* If they blame all their "crazy exes" and take zero accountability, they lack self-awareness and are a massive red flag.
**13. "How do you handle stress or failure?"**
*Why ask this?* A marriage will face illness, job loss, and grief. You need to know if your partner crumbles under pressure or steps up to the plate.

## Category 5: The "Dealbreakers"

**14. "What are your absolute non-negotiables in a marriage?"**
*Why ask this?* Let them draw their boundaries early. You might realize immediately that you cannot fulfill their primary requirement.
**15. "What are your thoughts on having children? When do you see that happening, if at all?"**
*Why ask this?* Never get married assuming you will "change their mind" about kids later. 

## The Golden Rule of the First Meeting

Pay less attention to *what* they say, and more attention to *how* they answer. Do they get defensive when you ask about money? Do they interrupt you constantly? Do they make eye contact? 

An arranged marriage is a massive legal, emotional, and social contract. Do not let the pressure of "what will society say" stop you from conducting a rigorous, intelligent interview.
